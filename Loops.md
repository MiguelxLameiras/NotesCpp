# Loops

[Video being studied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1AwR-un4Hk&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&index=14) <--

- **For Loops** - `for(int i=0; i<5; i++)`, the first statement initializes, the second part is a condition for the loop to execute, and the final modifies the variable that controls the condition.

- **While Loops** - `while(i<5)`, it loops while the condition is true. 

- **Do While Loops** - `do while(i<5)`, it's almost the same as a **while loop**, but it executes at least one time.
