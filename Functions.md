- **Functions** - Functions are blocks of code, that are design to perform a specific task. In classes those blocks are called methods.

- When a function is called, the compiler generates a call instruction, the entire stack frame for the function needs to be created, meaning things like parameters need to be pushed onto the stack and also the return address, so what happens is we jump to a different part of the binary and then we jump back.This jumping takes time. This is not the case for inline functions.
