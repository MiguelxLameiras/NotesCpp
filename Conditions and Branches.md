- **if statements** - we use this type of statements when we want to execute a code, only if a certain condition is validated. Regardless of the validation result, we always move on to a different section in memory, as result this type of statments do carry **overhead**. Actually most optimazed code always try not to use **branching / if statments**.

    - **Overhead** - overhead is the extra cost in resources (execution time, memory, or complexity) that a program has to pay to support a feature, but which is not part of the main work that the program wants to perform.
